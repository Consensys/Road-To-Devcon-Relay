#### Side note 1: Application still have a lot of jagged edges, thus ping me on Telegram if you need some help. Telgram handle is @abhimanyu121
#### Side note 2: Buying crypto from moonpay takes time(you will have to complete kyc), so you can copy address from information tab and send some ether and Moon tokens directly to the address.
#### Side note 3: Application currently works only with moon tokens to demonstrate usablity of stable coins to gain user trust.
#### Side note 4: Please refrain from inputing exceptional inputs as it is still under development.
