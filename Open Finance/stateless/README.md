# Stateless

“A person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law” – The international legal definition of a stateless person

There are an [estimated 12 million stateless peoples globally](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/11/1025561), according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). Modern examples of statelessness include the Rohingya, Palestinaians, Kurds, and more. War, famine, climate change, occupation, and ethnic cleansing are just some of the causes of statelessness. The condition of statelessness [deprives millions of people of their most basic rights](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-statelessness-conference-factb/factbox-where-are-the-worlds-stateless-people-idUSKCN1TR00J), such as education, healthcare, housing, and jobs.

Statelessness is a problem that borders and nation states perpetuate.

This blockchain based "Stateless" social media platform aims to help address the problems that stateless people face. It does so by offering the possibility to:

* acquire individual and collective digital identity
* build networks and community
* send remittances
* exchange socially valuable services
* make and vote on proposals
* access support
* act immutably
* engage directly with others without third parties or intermediaries
* fight corruption and abuse of human rights

Most of all, Stateless aims to support the dignity and lives of all people irrespective of states and borders.

This is a proof-of-concept only. The core element of the Stateless platform enables verification of profiles on the Ethereum blockchain. It can be run on your local machine by following these steps:

1. clone this repository
2. cd into the root directory
3. run: npm run dev

Note: You should have MetaMask installed to interact with the contracts.

Here is a screenshot of the Stateless landing page that you will see when you spin up a local implementation:
