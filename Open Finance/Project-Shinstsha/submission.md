## Project Name
Project Shintsha

## Project Summary
This is a research on how remote organic farmers who have whatsapp enabled mobiles can access the mainstream market by directly accessing consumers via whatsapp and web3. Shintsha is an online decentralized marketplace for farmers to upload their goods, receive orders, deliver items and receive money. Consumers can order for goods and services by choosing any product they like and farmers are notified via whatsapp with details of order. Whatsapp was chosen because it is being used by a greater percentage of the African economy and this remote farmers can easily communicate with it. The farmers can register via whatsapp, upload products, check notification, view products etc.



Shintsha allows farmers to: 
**connect with buyers and investors via whatsapp**, 
**the farmer can register his/her farm, products** 
**upload products**, 
**view product listings**,
