# **Micronews: Reinventing the Online News Economy**



## **Project Summary**
Micronews is the first app built on the `Equity Curation Model` (ECM). The ECM is a decentralized revenue and curation model for digital content. The **[ECM proposal paper](https://github.com/michaelcohen716/equity-curation-model)** documents the full architecture of the system. 

*****
*From the paper:*
> The ECM aims to:
> * use equity ownership to incentivize **consistent and reliable participation in content curation**
> * establish a **transparent, dynamic revenue model** to provide predictable income for creators
> * implement a mechanism for indirect governance by **rewarding quality content but avoiding censorship**

## **Run Project**
There's a live demo [here](https://micronews.michaelcohen716.now.sh), but if you'd like to run the project locally:
* `cd micronews`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

If you access the demo at the deployed link or locally, make sure to approve the Metamask connection. Given the constraints of a hackathon timeline, declining the MetaMask request will result in an error.
